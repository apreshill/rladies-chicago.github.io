      <description>Our first 2019 Meetup was a series of lightning talks based on what we learned at rstudio::conf2019. This year, six R-Ladies Chicago members were at rstudio::conf (and we met even more attendees from Chicago!). Overall, the conference was inspiring and we are excited to use what we learned to host great events for R-Ladies Chicago in 2019!
Florencia Mangini wrote a great blog post recapping our meetup. Be sure to check it out!</description>
