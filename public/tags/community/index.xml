      <description>Our first 2019 Meetup was a series of lightning talks based on what we learned at rstudio::conf2019. This year, six R-Ladies Chicago members were at rstudio::conf (and we met even more attendees from Chicago!). Overall, the conference was inspiring and we are excited to use what we learned to host great events for R-Ladies Chicago in 2019!
Florencia Mangini wrote a great blog post recapping our meetup. Be sure to check it out!</description>

      <title>Introducing Chicago Schools Enrollment Data to R</title>

      <description>The City of Chicago and Chicago Public Schools (CPS) have made data on annual enrollments, school locations, and other school features available to the public. After a bit of wrangling (frankly maybe more than just a bit) these data can be used in R to get key visualizations.
My own interest in the schools data began with a desire to understand more about the spread of charter schools in the city, and also more about the sharp enrollment declines that some regular public high schools have experienced since the early ’00s.</description>
