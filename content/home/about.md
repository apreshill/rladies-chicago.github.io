**We are the Chicago Chapter of R-Ladies!**  
  
Our goal is to make the R programming language more popular and accessible especially among women. Anyone with an interest in R is welcome. You can be an R expert or novice. We will promote R, exchange ideas and knowledge and create a friendly network among women who use R!  
    
*All events are intended for all women who are interested in attending. We are emphatically queer and trans friendly.*
