**We are the Chicago Chapter of R-Ladies!**  
  
R-Ladies is a global organization whose mission is to promote gender diversity in the R community. Our goal is to encourage, inspire, and empower people of genders currently underrepresented in the R community.
  
Anyone with an interest in R is welcome--beginners, experts and everyone in between. We exchange ideas, share knowledge, and create a friendly network among women who use R!   
    
*All events are intended for all women and minority genders who are interested in attending. This includes, but is not limited to, cis/trans women, trans men, non-binary, genderqueer, agender. We are emphatically queer and trans friendly.*
