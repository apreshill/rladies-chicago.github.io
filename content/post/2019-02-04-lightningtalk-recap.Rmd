Our first 2019 Meetup was a series of [lightning talks](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-chicago/events/257346957/) based on what we learned at [rstudio::conf2019](https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-conf-2019). This year, _*six*_ R-Ladies Chicago members were at rstudio::conf (and we met even more attendees from Chicago!). Overall, the conference was inspiring and we are excited to use what we learned to host great events for R-Ladies Chicago in 2019!
