<p>Our first 2019 Meetup was a series of <a href="https://www.meetup.com/rladies-chicago/events/257346957/">lightning talks</a> based on what we learned at <a href="https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-conf-2019">rstudio::conf2019</a>. This year, <em><em>six</em></em> R-Ladies Chicago members were at rstudio::conf (and we met even more attendees from Chicago!). Overall, the conference was inspiring and we are excited to use what we learned to host great events for R-Ladies Chicago in 2019!</p>
