# Joining the Leadership Team   
    
\  
   
We are always looking for R-Ladies to join our leadership team (AKA the R-Ladies Chicago Board). A complete board typically has 6-7 members. Board members serve a 1-year term that starts either in January or June each year. Commitment ranges from 1-10 hours per month depending on responsibilities.   
  
If you are interested in joining our board, send a DM to a current board member on our Slack channel (preferred) or email chicago@rladies.org.  
  
Here are the minimum requests for a successful R-Ladies board membership, based on what we've learned over the past 2 years:  
  
1. **Attend quarterly in-person board meetings.** They run around 1.5-2 hours and are typically on the weekends somewhere in the Loop. Alternatively, we may meet as a board via videoconference (e.g., Zoom or Google Meet).  
  
2. **Check the R-Ladies Chicago organizer Slack channel at least weekly.** This is how we do most of our communication (as vs. email).  
  
3. **Help out with monthly Meetups during the year.** We don't have a fixed number that we require per year, but we do need at least 3 organizers at each Meetup to run things smoothly. Note that some of this support can also be remote (ie. preparing intro slides, ordering food). This is a commitment of anywhere from 1 hr - 10 hrs per Meetup you help with, depending if you're the lead organizer or not. Again, since we have a team, this is flexible depending on your schedule.  
  
4. **Represent R-Ladies in the wider data science community.** When you have the opportunity to network, provide mentoring, reach out online to speakers - we ask that you go for it! Some of our best partnerships have come from organizers taking initiative and planning events and making connections.
