      <description>Join us in welcoming tidyverse developer advocate and Twitter #rstats star Mara Averick!
What we&amp;rsquo;ll do:
We&amp;rsquo;re excited to welcome Mara Averick to speak at R-Ladies Chicago. We&amp;rsquo;ll hear from Mara Averick about a topic of her choosing.
Tentative Topic: Sustainers of the Tidyverse
Abstract: If a piece of open-source software is to survive its own success, it must have a healthy community of active contributors. The tidyverse, a collection of R packages for data science with a shared underlying design philosophy, has become popular in no small part because of its usability among those who do not consider themselves to be “programmers.</description>
